## How To Use:

### JavaScript
- For the User Script (on the browser), download TamperMonkey and just paste the contents of hack.js into an empty UserScript file and then just play the game!

### Python
- For the Python mini-console (which needs more work to be done), just run the Python file and do what it says.
- You will need minimum Python 3.10
- It's not yet finished! Still a lot of work to do... will really appreciate some pull requests, from style to logic.
- You will need to install aioconsole by using pip for best console usage!
- If you want to make another template function (feel free to make a pull request, for anything!), make sure its name ends with "_template"!
